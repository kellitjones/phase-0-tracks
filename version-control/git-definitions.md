# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

``` Version control allows you to save your code in different versions (of completeness), allowing you to switch and compare versions, preventing accidental deletion of your work or other complications. ```

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

``` A branch is a separate set of code or a specific version, based on your initial master set of code (or another branch). This maintains your initial set of code or your master branch. ```

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

``` Commits are used to save your code at specific stages. ```

* What is a merge conflict?

``` Merge conflicts happen when you try to merge two sets of code that are not within the save space or place in time.```





``` Just adding some stuff for the heck of it... Like a cool cat! ```
